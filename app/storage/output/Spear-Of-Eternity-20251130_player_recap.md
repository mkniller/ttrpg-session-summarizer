# Player Recap — Spear-Of-Eternity-20251130

Beneath a sky bruised by dusk and dust, the party pored over the battered map that had crossed their path. Among the faded lines and inked warnings, three locations beckoned. Resolute, they set out toward the forgotten ruins northwest of Al-Kesh, leaving the comforts of civilization behind. The road was long and meagre; after hard travel, they found fleeting warmth among a band of gypsies camped under the indifferent stars, sharing what little food they carried, each clutching hope for luck against what darkness awaited.

At dawn’s first weak light, the adventurers pressed north, threading between mountain ranges that clawed the sky. In the valley’s shadow, they stumbled upon an outpost—crumbling, abandoned, its walls pitted by wind and time. Seeking shelter, they entered the forlorn stronghold. Moonlight tangled with dust in the collapsed entry hall, while the floor bore small, hurried footprints.

A click betrayed a hidden pressure plate beneath Graak’s heavy step. From beneath broken stone, a scorpion burst forth, its stinger gleaming in the silver light. Without hesitation, Graak’s great axe fell with a brutal arc, cleaving the creature in two.

Their nerves raw, the party moved from chamber to chamber, each step measured and cautious. Bahl pressed an ear to a cracked door but found only silence. Durl eyed suspicious drag marks, lobbing a stone ahead—only the hollow clang of metal answered him, no trap sprung. Trusting his luck, Bahl pushed open a door, only to be met with the snap of a tripwire. A rock flew from the shadows, striking him hard, pain blooming as blood wetted his tunic.

Within, Bahl’s torchlight flickered over walls etched with thousands of tally marks—each a silent testament to madness or memory—and a small wooden icon of a desert saint, forlorn on the floor. Graak inspected the icon, finding no threat, and claimed it.

As their eyes adjusted, a ghostly figure caught their gaze: a weeping wraith, draped in sorrow, huddled in a corner. Its moans filled the chill air, but it paid them no heed. Bahl called out to the specter, but only silence answered. Durl summoned the power to turn the undead—twice—but the spirit lingered, unbothered. Graak, bold but mortal, drew near, only to be seized by a primal fear that left him quaking.

In a nearby chamber, an ancient soldier stood rigid at attention, armor dulled by centuries, lips parting only to utter, “Guard the tomb.” The party pressed on, puzzling over doors—some locked, some yielding under their touch.

It was then they found Larry, a grizzled tinkerer hunched over a cluttered workbench. He greeted them with wary curiosity, revealing that he had called these ruins home for fifteen, perhaps twenty, years, chasing but never finding the legendary tomb rumored to lie beneath. He eyed the wooden icon with interest, trading two healing herbs to Graak for the relic. Larry sketched a rough map of the outpost’s layout, speaking of a central locked chamber and unexplored stairwells, before joining the party’s uneasy truce.

A faint, chilling cry drifted from behind a southern door—an infant’s wail, thin and desperate. The sound drew the party, and when they entered, the crying grew sharper. Durl found the source: an embalmed infant, wrapped as a mummy, shrieking into the gloom. As he reached for the bundle, it lashed out, clawing at him with wicked, razor nails. Instantly, sand erupted across the floor, disgorging biting beetles with shells like tarnished coins. Graak’s razor chain flashed, sweeping the vermin into silence, but the infant’s baleful claws raked Durl, drawing blood. The horror of it all sent Larry fleeing, slamming the outpost’s door behind him. Durl, desperate, staggered through the threshold, the infant’s wails echoing off the stone, until Graak pressed a healing herb to his wounds, dragging him back from death’s edge.

Further exploration revealed a cracked basin carved with ancient glyphs. On the floor, a silver bangle glinted—a hint of forgotten wealth. Near it, Bahl uncovered a hidden trapdoor. With brute force, Graak smashed the panel open, unearthing a rusty key. Bahl claimed it, and the party tried their luck on the locked doors. The key yielded to an old lock, revealing a chamber choked with toppled stones and weather-faded banners, each marked by a sigil none could name. The party burned the sigil into their memory, intending to search for meaning in Al-Kesh.

But the chamber held other dangers. Two rock hyenas prowled in the shadows, hackles raised, eyes burning with hunger. Bahl retreated, sealing the door on the beasts’ malice. The party, shaken, decided against returning to the room of the weeping infant and instead regrouped.

They returned to where the ghost still lingered, weighing their options. But before plans could settle, a tomb guard struck out at Durl, dropping him in a heap, life hanging by a thread. Graak struggled to drag Durl to safety, his first attempt slipping, but fortune favored him and he succeeded with a final effort. Bahl wasted no time, forcing a healing herb down Durl’s throat to stave off death, though Durl remained senseless. Whip in hand, Bahl charged a tomb guard, landing a vicious blow. The foe lashed back, felling Bahl with a single, brutal strike.

Graak’s hands shook as he pressed a healing herb to Bahl’s wounds, stanching the flow of blood and keeping fate at bay. Durl, newly revived, called forth healing magics, returning strength and breath to Bahl’s battered form.

Barred doors and rope held the tomb guards at bay long enough for the party to catch their breath and weigh the cost of further conflict. Bahl tried to trip a guard with his bolas, but fortune turned away. At last, battered and bone-tired, the party retreated, barricading themselves in a defensible corner of the outpost. They choked down dwindling rations, tended wounds, and prepared for a restless night beneath ancient stone—each soul haunted by the day’s lessons, the memory of traps, the hunger for light, and the whisper of hidden passages yet unfound.

Shadows crept deeper as they huddled together, uncertain what the next day would bring, but alive—for now—within the cold embrace of the ruins.
