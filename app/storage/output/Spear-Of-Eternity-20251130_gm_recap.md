# GM Recap — Spear-Of-Eternity-20251130

**1. Session Summary (for GM)**

The party journeyed northwest from Al-Kesh toward the desert ruins, guided by a map from the Pharaoh’s advisors. After a night camping with traveling gypsies, they entered an abandoned outpost near the ruins, where they navigated traps, encountered a weeping ghost, and met Larry Greenbottle, a halfling tinkerer. The group traded with Larry and uncovered clues about the tomb’s mysteries.

Exploration led them to a room with a wailing embalmed infant mummy. Interacting with the mummy triggered a dangerous combat with biting sand beetles and, later, tomb guards. Two party members were rendered unconscious but were stabilized and healed by their companions. Resource management became critical, and after narrowly surviving, the party chose to rest inside the dungeon, missing several secret areas. The session ended with a recap of missed opportunities and discussion of future plans.
