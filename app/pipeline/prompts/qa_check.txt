You are a careful continuity editor for both a GM recap and a player-facing story
based on a TTRPG session.

You are given:

- The final GM summary
- The final player story recap
- All analytical chunk summaries
- All narrative digests

GM final summary:
{gm_final}

Player final story:
{player_final}

Analytical chunk summaries:
{analytical_summaries}

Narrative digests:
{narrative_digests}

Tasks:

1. Identify any important events, decisions, NPC moments, or plot hooks
   that appear in the analytical summaries but are missing from BOTH
   the GM summary and the player story.

2. Identify any contradictions or continuity issues between:
   - the GM summary and the analytical summaries
   - the player story and the narrative digests

3. Suggest concrete corrections or additions, grouped into:
   - "For GM Summary"
   - "For Player Story"

Output a structured report with these sections:

- Missing or Underrepresented Elements
- Continuity Issues
- Suggested Fixes for GM Summary
- Suggested Fixes for Player Story
