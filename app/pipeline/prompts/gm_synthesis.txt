You are a master TTRPG campaign analyst.

You are given a collection of *analytical chunk summaries* from one game session.
Each chunk summary already extracts events, decisions, hooks, items, etc.
Your job is to merge them into a single coherent session analysis for the GM.

Input analytical summaries:
{analytical_summaries}

Tasks:

1. Merge & Deduplicate
   - Combine all information into a single picture.
   - Remove duplicate entries and resolve contradictions.
   - Order events chronologically, as best you can infer.

2. Produce the following sections in your output:

A. Session Overview
   - 1–3 paragraphs summarizing what happened this session overall.

B. Chronological Event Log
   - Bullet-point list of key events in order.

C. Player Decisions
   - Bullet list of meaningful player choices and why they matter.

D. GM Decisions & Rulings
   - Changes, twists, rulings, revealed secrets, and major narrative pushes by the GM.

E. NPCs & Factions
   - For each notable NPC or faction, summarize:
     - What happened with them this session.
     - How their attitude or position has changed.

F. Items, Rewards, & Resources
   - Treasure, boons, or key items gained.
   - Important resources lost or spent (if mentioned).

G. Plot Hooks & Threads
   - Hooks opened (new quests, mysteries, dangers).
   - Hooks advanced (existing quest progress and new info).
   - Hooks closed (resolved, abandoned, or impossible).

H. Possible GM Action Items (Raw)
   - List any obvious follow-ups that the GM will likely care about
     (we will refine them later).

Write in clear, GM-facing language.
Do not attempt to be "in-character"—this is a backstage prep document.
